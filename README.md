Voice Assistant is a Django web app that processes voice input to respond smartly to user queries, acting as a JARVIS-like assistant. It integrates with external APIs to provide real-time answers on Wikipedia topics, current time, location searches, and YouTube results, offering users quick information and links based on voice commands.
